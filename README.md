# Ambiguous-Musical-Figures

Welcome! 

This repository includes the notebooks and R markdown files for the data cleaning, EDA, and analysis for my ambiguous musical figures project. In this project, I designed a quantitative survey experiment to examine ambiguous figure perception in a musical context. Ever seen the duck-rabbit phenomenon? 
Essentially, this is the musical equivalent!

## Introduction ## 

The purpose of this study was to investigate flexibility in forming and changing an interpretation of two tonally bi-stable 
(i.e., modulatory) musical excerpts from the Classical period. 

The primary research questions were:

1) Are the excerpts, in fact, perceptually bi-stable?
2) If so, is the flexibility of interpretation dependent on which conceptual knowledge is being used to form the interpretation? 
In other words, do differences in auditory attending strategies change the availability of interpretations or the ease of changing 
between two interpretations? 
3) Is interpretational flexibility related to the amount of training in music theory or experience with relevant music theory concepts 
(scale degrees, Galant schemata)? 

### Terms Defined ###

**Scale Degree:** a number or solfege syllable denoting the position of a pitch within the Western tonal system, ordered from 1 through 7. 

**Galant Schemata:** a meaningful pattern known to scholars to be used by composers and performers, and which are relevant musical chunks for listeners.
Think about Pachabell’s canon, that repeating figure is a shema! They have been given names by scholars. The primary ones used here are Prinner and Romanesca schema. 

**Modulation:** refers here to the modern usage of the term where a piece of music changed from one key (e.g., C major) to another (e.g. G major).

**Soprano (line):** a single musical line of a schema pattern, played in the highest voice.

**Bass (line):** a single musical line of a schema pattern, played in the lowest voice.

**Exposition:** the first section of a sonata form movement.

**Recapitulation:** the last section of a sonata form movement, is a repeated but slightly modified form of the exposition.  

### Hypotheses ###

The resulting hypotheses were: 

**H0:** This excerpt is not amenable to multiple interpretations, using either scale degrees or Galant schemata.

**H1a:** This excerpt is amenable to multiple interpretations in terms of schemata; however, one interpretation (Prinner) 
may be easier to hear than the other (Romanesca). 

**H1b:** Furthermore, the availability of and ease of change between interpretations may differ between the expositional 
and recapitulatory versions of the excerpt (with the Romanesca more available in the recapitulation).

**H2:** Participants should be able to more easily form and alternate between scale degree interpretations for a single voice 
(soprano, bass) than for Galant schemata (which are dependent on the presence of multiple, co-occurring features). 

**H3:** The ability to form and alternate Galant schemata interpretations may be dependent on moderate familiarity, but not a high-level expertise with Galant schemata (Expertise categories = Novice, Intermediate, Expert). Expertise should therefore be related to increased rigidity of interpretation (Ease of Change on a scale from 1 to 7, low to high), particularly for Schema interpretations, as such categories are overlearned and more likely to be automatically active during listening.


## Method ##

Data was collected online in Qualtrics using qualitative survey methods. This study uses methods inspired by those used in ambiguous figure 
perception in the domain of vision (e.g., Brugger, 1999). Participants were presented with two short musical excerpts in auditory format—the 
transitions from the exposition and recapitulation of Mozart’s Piano Sonata no. 2, K. 280, iii—after which they were prompted to rate the ease in 
forming two different interpretations presented in visual format using scale degrees and/or Galant schemata labels. Following this, they were then 
asked to alternate between the two provided interpretations and rate the ease of change. Two types of attending strategies were investigated: 

1) focused attention through scale-degree interpretations of either soprano or bass lines (i.e., a single auditory stream; Bregman, 1990), and 
2) diffuse or shifting attention, prompted through assessing an interpretation of an ordering of Galant schemata. 

Unlike focusing on a scale degree interpretation in a single voice, hearing a passage as a schema requires attending to multiple, co-occurring 
features at once. Because the latter requires more attentional and memory resources, hearing and alternating a schema interpretation is likely more challenging. The final portion of the survey collected general information regarding the participants’ music theory training (years of training), their experience with scale degrees and Galant schemata, and their familiarity with the sonata movement in the study. Taken together, the information gathered in the first part of the study addresses the first and second research questions above (i.e., whether the excerpts are bistable, and if bistability changes with conceptual prompt and auditory attending strategy), and the biographical information regarding music theory training gathered at the end of the survey addresses the final research question (i.e., whether the results observed depend on previous training and experience). 

## Participants ## 

A total of nineteen persons (n = 19) participated in the study. Of these, ten were professors of music theory, six were current graduate students in 
music theory, two were post-doctoral students in music theory, and one was a recent PhD graduate in music theory. Out of the 19 participants, a total 
of 3 reported having perfect pitch (all professors). Participants were recruited online through email (Music Theory and Cognition listserv in the 
Department of Music Studies at Northwestern, the Society for Music Theory Pedagogy Interest Group listserv, and by personal email contact) and 
online posts (Society for Music Theory Humanities Commons page). 

## Stimuli ## 

 The stimuli were two short excerpts from the expositional and recapitulatory transitions of Mozart’s Piano Sonata no. 2, K. 280, iii. 
 The audio clips were extracted from Kristian Bezuidenhout’s Mozart: Keyboard Music, vols 8 & 9 (2016) for fortepiano using Audacity. 
 The expositional transition included the end of the main theme through the medial caesura totaling 16 seconds 
 (from 0:08-0:24 in the recording), and the recapitulatory transition contained the same adjusted material totaling 19 seconds 
 (from 2:09-2:28 in the recording). Two interpretations for each excerpt were created for bass and soprano lines, as well as orderings of Galant 
 schemata.
 
 ## Procedure ## 
 
 The survey consisted of three parts: consent documentation and introduction, the experimental body of the survey (K. 280 ratings), and 
 biographical information collection. At the beginning of the survey, participants read a letter of information and completed the consent 
 documentation. They then completed an introductory training module, which introduced bistable perception through the original duck-rabbit 
 figure drawn and presented in Jastrow (1899). They completed the task using this picture. Firstly, they were asked to form 
 the interpretation RABBIT, and rate the ease of forming this interpretation on a Likert scale from 1 (cannot see at all) to 7 (can clearly see it). 
 Following this, they were presented with a second interpretation, DUCK, and completed the same procedure. Participants were then prompted to view 
 the image continuously and rate the ease of changing the interpretation from RABBIT to DUCK on a Likert scale from 1 (cannot alternate interpretations) 
 to 7 (can easily alternate interpretations). Lastly, participants replicated the task in a practice session with a musical stimulus—the modulating 
 transition from the exposition of Mozart’s Piano Sonata no 7, K. 309, i. They were asked to rate the ease of hearing two bass line interpretations 
 on a Likert scale from 1 (cannot hear at all) to 7 (can easily hear), as well as the ease of changing these two interpretations (1-7).

The experimental body of the survey gathered ease of hearing and ease of change ratings for the two excerpts from the Presto of K. 280. 
The survey was organized into two main blocks (exposition, recapitulation), which contained three blocks for each attentional condition 
(bass line, soprano line, schemata). Each attentional condition (bass, soprano, schemata) contained three trials each, one rating for each 
interpretation (e.g., Prinner, Romanesca), and one rating for the ease of change between the two presented interpretations. This resulted in a total of 18 trials. The presentation order of the excerpts was randomized such that the exposition or recapitulation blocks could be presented in either order, the 
attentional condition blocks (bass, soprano, schema) could be presented in any order, and within each condition, the order of presentation of 
each interpretation trials (e.g., Prinner, Romanesca) was randomized. Before starting the first set of ratings in either the exposition or 
recapitulation, participants were prompted to listen to the excerpt without any interpretation provided. Once within a given block (e.g., Recapitulation)
and condition (e.g., Schema), participants completed both ease of hearing and ease of change ratings before moving onto the next condition 
(e.g., bass line). Once all three conditions were completed (bass, soprano, schema), they moved onto the next main block (e.g., exposition). 
Participants were provided with an audio clip of the excerpt for each rating and could listen as many times as they liked. For the ease of change 
ratings, participants were encouraged to listen to the excerpt multiple times and to change interpretations on each successive listening. 

The final part of the survey gathered various biographical information that was used to create expertise designations (see Data cleaning and 
pre-processing below). Participants were prompted to provide their education level, number of years of music theory and aural skills experience 
(both training and teaching), expertise in scale degree hearing and with Galant schemata, their familiarity with the excerpt (hearing and analysis), 
if they had perfect pitch, and what types of strategies they used for forming and changing interpretations in the task they had just completed. 

## Primary Findings and Discussion ## 

Here, I will contextualize the findings in light of the original hypotheses. 

#### Null Hypothesis ####

Firstly, we can safely reject the null hypothesis: 

**H0:** This excerpt is not amenable to multiple interpretations, for either scale degree interpretations or Galant schemata.

Both excerpts were amenable to multiple interpretations for both scale degree lines and Galant schemata. 

#### First Hypothesis ####

Regarding the first hypothesis:

**H1a:** This excerpt is amenable to multiple interpretations in terms of schemata; however, one interpretation (Prinner) may be easier to hear than the other (Romanesca).

and 

**H1b:** Furthermore, the availability of and ease of change between interpretations may differ between the expositional and recapitulatory versions of the excerpt (with the Romanesca more available in the recapitulation).

Hypothesis 1a was confirmed as the Prinner schema was rated as easier to hear than the Romanesca. However, the significant interaction between expertise and modulation type showed that this effect stemmed from rigidity in interpreation in the expert group only. The intermediate group was more easily able to alternate interpretations, showing that for this group, the excerpt was in fact more bistable. Hypothesis 1b was rejected as there was no interaction between modulation type and sonata section, indicating that the order of presentation did not affect interpretation formation.


#### Second Hypothesis ####

For the second hypothesis:

**H2:** Participants should be able to more easily form and alternate between scale degree interpretations for a single voice (soprano, bass) than for Galant schemata (which are dependent on the presence of multiple, co-occurring features). 

The second hypothesis was partially supported. The significant main effect of attended feature showed that, overall, bass lines and Galant schemata were equally perceptible, but that the soprano line was much more difficult to hear. The significant interaction of sonata section and attended feature showed that this effect was largely due to differences between the bass and soprano line ratings (DV1) in the recapitulation. I interpret this effect as arising from difficulty in forming interpretations in the exposition in general. However, without a main effect of sonata section, it is difficult to confirm this. The significant interaction of attended feature and modulation type also supports the second hypothesis: early and late modulation interpretations are equally available when attending to the bass voice; however, when switching to a multi-feature attending strategy needed to assess Galant schemata interpretations, Prinner and Romanesca interpretations become much less equally available. 


#### Third Hypothesis ####

And lastly,

**H3:** The ability to form and alternate Galant schemata interpretations may be dependent on moderate familiarity, but not a high-level expertise with Galant schemata (Expertise categories = Novice, Intermediate, Expert). Expertise should therefore be related to increased rigidity of interpretation (Ease of Change on a scale from 1 to 7, low to high), particularly for Schema interpretations, as such categories are overlearned and more likely to be automatically active during listening.

The final hypothesis regarding expertise was supported in multiple ways. The significant main effects of expertise for both DV1 and DV2 showed that the Intermediate group had the highest ease of hearing and ease of change ratings, confirming that they were more easily able to hear both interpretations, and were much more able to alternate between interpretations. The low ease of change (DV2) ratings in both novice and expert groups are particularly interesting because these lower ratings can be attributed to different potential causes. For the novices, the low ease of change (DV2) ratings can be attributed to a lack of category representations for Galant schemata. Contrastingly, the expert groups’ lower ease of change ratings can be attributed to overlearning of these categories, resulting in a rigidity of interpretation. For the intermediate group, there are enough Galant schemata representations to select from, but the sparser (less elaborated) nature of these memory traces means that alternating intrepretations is much easier.
