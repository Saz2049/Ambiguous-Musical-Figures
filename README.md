## Introduction ## 

The purpose of this study was to investigate flexibility in forming and changing an interpretation of two tonally bi-stable 
(i.e., modulatory) musical excerpts from the Classical period. 

The primary research questions were:

1) Are the excerpts, in fact, perceptually bi-stable?
2) If so, is the flexibility of interpretation dependent on which conceptual knowledge is being used to form the interpretation? 
In other words, do differences in auditory attending strategies change the availability of interpretations or the ease of changing 
between two interpretations? 
3) Is interpretational flexibility related to the amount of training in music theory or experience with relevant music theory concepts 
(scale degrees, Galant schemata)? 

## Method ##

Data was collected online in Qualtrics using qualitative survey methods. This study uses methods inspired by those used in ambiguous figure 
perception in the domain of vision (e.g., Brugger, 1999). Participants were presented with two short musical excerpts in auditory format—the 
transitions from the exposition and recapitulation of Mozart’s Piano Sonata no. 2, K. 280, iii—after which they were prompted to rate the ease in 
forming two different interpretations presented in visual format using scale degrees and/or Galant schemata labels. Following this, they were then 
asked to alternate between the two provided interpretations and rate the ease of change. Two types of attending strategies were investigated: 

1) focused attention through scale-degree interpretations of either soprano or bass lines (i.e., a single auditory stream; Bregman, 1990), and 
2) diffuse or shifting attention, prompted through assessing an interpretation of an ordering of Galant schemata. 

Unlike focusing on a scale degree interpretation in a single voice, hearing a passage as a schema requires attending to multiple, co-occurring 
features at once. Because the latter requires more attentional resources (WM) and more active simulator traces (LTM), hearing and alternating a 
schema interpretation is likely more challenging. The final portion of the survey collected general information regarding the participants’ music 
theory training (years of training), their experience with scale degrees and Galant schemata, and their familiarity with the sonata movement in the 
study. Taken together, the information gathered in the first part of the study addresses the first and second research questions above (i.e., whether 
the excerpts are bistable, and if bistability changes with conceptual prompt and auditory attending strategy), and the biographical information regarding 
music theory training gathered at the end of the survey addresses the final research question (i.e., whether the results observed depend on previous 
training and experience). 

## Participants ## 

A total of nineteen persons (n = 19) participated in the study. Of these, ten were professors of music theory, six were current graduate students in 
music theory, two were post-doctoral students in music theory, and one was a recent PhD graduate in music theory. Out of the 19 participants, a total 
of 3 reported having perfect pitch (all professors). Participants were recruited online through email (Music Theory and Cognition listserv in the 
Department of Music Studies at Northwestern, the Society for Music Theory Pedagogy Interest Group listserv, and by personal email contact) and 
online posts (Society for Music Theory Humanities Commons page). 

## Stimuli ## 

 The stimuli were two short excerpts from the expositional and recapitulatory transitions of Mozart’s Piano Sonata no. 2, K. 280, iii. 
 The audio clips were extracted from Kristian Bezuidenhout’s Mozart: Keyboard Music, vols 8 & 9 (2016) for fortepiano using Audacity. 
 The expositional transition included the end of the main theme through the medial caesura totaling 16 seconds 
 (from 0:08-0:24 in the recording), and the recapitulatory transition contained the same adjusted material totaling 19 seconds 
 (from 2:09-2:28 in the recording). Two interpretations for each excerpt were created for bass and soprano lines, as well as orderings of Galant 
 schemata.
 
 ## Procedure ## 
 
 The survey consisted of three parts: consent documentation and introduction, the experimental body of the survey (K. 280 ratings), and 
 biographical information collection. At the beginning of the survey, participants read a letter of information and completed the consent 
 documentation. They then completed an introductory training module, which introduced bistable perception through the original duck-rabbit 
 figure drawn and presented in Jastrow (1899). They completed the task using this picture. Firstly, they were asked to form 
 the interpretation RABBIT, and rate the ease of forming this interpretation on a Likert scale from 1 (cannot see at all) to 7 (can clearly see it). 
 Following this, they were presented with a second interpretation, DUCK, and completed the same procedure. Participants were then prompted to view 
 the image continuously and rate the ease of changing the interpretation from RABBIT to DUCK on a Likert scale from 1 (cannot alternate interpretations) 
 to 7 (can easily alternate interpretations). Lastly, participants replicated the task in a practice session with a musical stimulus—the modulating 
 transition from the exposition of Mozart’s Piano Sonata no 7, K. 309, i. They were asked to rate the ease of hearing two bass line interpretations 
 on a Likert scale from 1 (cannot hear at all) to 7 (can easily hear), as well as the ease of changing these two interpretations (1-7).

The experimental body of the survey gathered ease of hearing and ease of change ratings for the two excerpts from the Presto of K. 280. 
The survey was organized into two main blocks (exposition, recapitulation), which contained three blocks for each attentional condition 
bass line, soprano line, schemata). Each attentional condition (bass, soprano, schemata) contained three trials each, one rating for each 
interpretation, and one rating for the ease of change between the two presented interpretations. This resulted in a total of 18 trials. The 
presentation order of the excerpts was randomized such that the exposition or recapitulation blocks could be presented in either order, the 
attentional condition blocks (bass, soprano, schema) could be presented in any order, and within each condition, the order of presentation of 
each interpretation trials (e.g., Prinner, Romanesca) was randomized. Before starting the first set of ratings in either the exposition or 
recapitulation, participants were prompted to listen to the excerpt without any interpretation provided. Once within a given block (e.g., Recapitulation)
and condition (e.g., Schema), participants completed both ease of hearing and ease of change ratings before moving onto the next condition 
(e.g., bass line). Once all three conditions were completed (bass, soprano, schema), they moved onto the next main block (e.g., exposition). 
Participants were provided with an audio clip of the excerpt for each rating and could listen as many times as they liked. For the ease of change 
ratings, participants were encouraged to listen to the excerpt multiple times and to change interpretations on each successive listening. 

The final part of the survey gathered various biographical information that was used to create expertise designations (see Data cleaning and 
pre-processing below). Participants were prompted to provide their education level, number of years of music theory and aural skills experience 
(both training and teaching), expertise in scale degree hearing and with Galant schemata, their familiarity with the excerpt (hearing and analysis), 
if they had perfect pitch, and what types of strategies they used for forming and changing interpretations in the task they had just completed.
