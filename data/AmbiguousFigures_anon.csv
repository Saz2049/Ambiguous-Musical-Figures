With absolute pitch, I hear fixed-do syllables constantly (do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si for C-D-E-F-G-A-B disregarding accidentals) given early music training in country of origin, so the scale-degree identities were just somehow there. In addition, on a more reflective level, of course there are cues for the activation of the Modulating Prinner schema in a spot like this (e.g., surface activity that's speedy, harmonic modulation, connecting to Converging Cadence pattern at the end)---the top down cue of ""this is 3-over-1 becoming immediately 6-over-4 in the new key"" is probably the strongest factor of all, which doesn't really leave much room for ambiguity.
